# README FIRST!

This project contains the models of different case studies where the DICE 
Simulation Tool has been used. These are provided as illustrative examples of 
the capabilities of the Simulation Tool. 

Specifically we provide:

* Simplified Posidonia. START WITH THIS SIMPLIFIED CASE STUDY. You can find more 
  information in its dedicated [README.txt](0-Simplified-Posidonia/README.txt) 
  file and in the [Getting Started: An illustrative 
  example](https://github.com/dice-project/DICE-Simulation/wiki/Getting-Started) 
  wiki page. 
* Posidonia. A more complex case study analyzed in the paper [1].
* NewsAsset. Another complex case study whose results are presented in [2,3].

**Please note that from the above, only the *Simplified Posidonia* case study is 
designed to be executed out of the box.** The other case studies need to be
properly parameterized according to the data provided in the corresponding
publications, and may take long time to be simulated.
